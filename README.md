This is a project or my first largest project (jarvis). 
Inspired by CodeWithHarry -an Indian coder or tutor
A little or use of AI to review my code and suggestion 
to make my code better.
I have attached the requirements.txt to ensure that 
you have downloaded the packages
to install the package from requirements.txt 
command:- pip install -r file_name
